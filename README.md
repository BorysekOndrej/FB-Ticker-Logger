# FB-Ticker-Logger
Minor part of my seminary work that shows how much data can we see on FB.

It's a GreaseMonkey script, which will automatically retrieve and parse data in browser. Those reports are send to PHP server, which will save  them for later analysis.

# Warning
Some inputs and all outputs are NOT sanitized. It's just a proof of concept. Also, trying to access it on my domain won't work, whole subdomain protected.

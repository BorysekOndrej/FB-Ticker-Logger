# FB-Ticker-Logger
Minor part of my seminary work, which probably wonâ€™t even be included. It's meant to show how much information we share on FB through our activities.

I've changed my approach to this this project. It's no longer based on http responses, as they proved to be difficult to generate requests for. Now I'm making a GreaseMonkey script, which will automatically retrieve and parse data in browser. Those reports are send to PHP server, which will evaluate them.

# FB-Ticker-Logger
This script was created as a part of my seminary work, but for legal reasons wasn't included.
It shows how much data about activities of our friends we can see on FB.

It's a GreaseMonkey script, which will automatically retrieve and parse data in browser. Those reports are send to PHP server, which will save them for later analysis.

# Warning
Some inputs and all outputs are NOT sanitized. It's just a proof of concept. Also, trying to access it on my domain won't work, whole subdomain protected.
